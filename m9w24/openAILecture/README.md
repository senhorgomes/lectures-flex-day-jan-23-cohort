# OpenAI

OpenAI is an artificial intelligence company. You might be familiar with their work "Chat-GPT".

Aside from this they develop other models that can be used for a wide variety of scenarios.

## Models

What is a model?

- Its a file that is generated by analyzing sampled and labeled data

Model is essentially a file that has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns. We want to have a model that is so well trained that it can eventually process additional data to make correct predictions.

For example you give your model 100s of poses of hands so that it can learn what a "hand" is.

They are difficult to make, infact many big tech companies have struggled with it.

Each model specializes in a different area. There isn't a single perfect one and many have pros and cons.

The ones we tested out today were:

- GPT 3.5 - [gpt-3.5-turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5)

- Whisper - [whisper-1](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/whisper)

- DaVinci - [text-davinci-003](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5)

## But isn't DaVinci depecrated?

Yes, as a matter of fact, we can use many models that are still deprecated. Some might say that some depecrated models perform better than current models. This goes back to the pros and cons of many models and developers personal experience with them.

## Why is it important to learn about AI?

With the current AI "boom" and how it it will continue to change the world, its a good idea to at least understand what AI is, and how we can use as a tool in our day to day jobs.

## Should we implement AI in every app?

Its a great feature and tool. But your whole app doesn't have to be built around it, and every app shouldn't have it. Keep in mind at the end of the day, the API is like all APIs. We request information, receive it, and utilize in our app.

In fact some APIs may give you better more accurate information. (Weather API vs OpenAI API)

At the end of the day, this is just an API that we can use as a tool and we shouldn't be scared of it. We should try to see how it can broaden our skills.
