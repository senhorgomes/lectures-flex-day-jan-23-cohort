## Models

What is a model?

- Its a file that is generated by analyzing sampled and labeled data

Model is essentially a file that has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns. We want to have a model that is so well trained that it can eventually process additional data to make correct predictions.

For example you give your model 100s of poses of hands so that it can learn what a "hand" is.

They are difficult to make, infact many big tech companies have struggled with it.

## Steps of Creating a Proper Model

Collection of Data
Cleaning of the Data
Labeling Data
Organize the Data
Process Data

This may sound difficult to do. In many ways using an existing model may be easier than to create your own.
You can also use Synthetic Data(e.g. 3D models).
