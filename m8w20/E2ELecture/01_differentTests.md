End-to-End testing


Unit Testing - Storybook/ Mocha(Framework) & Chai(Assertion Library) - We test a single function/component completely isolated

Jest - Integrated testing - Is more combining different parts and seeing how well they play with each other

End-to-End testing - How a user can interact with the website

# Jest
- CLI approach to automated testing
- Intended for unit-testing and integration testing
- Very, very fast and efficient
- Shines when used for testing functions, components, specific focus

# Cypress

- Wholistic approach to testing (end-to-end)
- Can be used to test core application features
- Access to the back-end is unnecessary to write tests
- Free! Very high caliber for free software
