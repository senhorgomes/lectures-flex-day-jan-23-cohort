# End-to-End Testing with Cypress

* [X] What is Cypress?
* [X] Getting Started with Cypress

## Jest

* CLI approach to automated testing
* Intended for unit-testing and integration testing
* Very, very fast and efficient
* Shines when used for testing functions, components, specific focus!

## Cypress

* Wholistic approach to testing (end-to-end)
* Can be used to test core application features (many components working together)
* Agnostic to the stack used * access to the back-end is unnecessary to write tests
* Free! (There are paid options, but we're fortunate to have a full-featured free application of this calibre!)

## Why Use Cypress?

* Flexible * we can test apps with, or without, access to source code.
* It is capable of taking screenshots and videos of tests.
* One of the most well documented free softwares out there!

## About Cypress

Cypress is a very robust program, capable of automated testing. The documentation is top-tier, a true treat and pleasure to work with. Tests, similar to Jest/Mocha/Chai, are written in near-plain English, allowing for a wide array of team members to contribute to a project's quality assurance. Tests like these are expected to be run before (and during process of) launch of a project or version thereofâ€”think of it as a safeguard step to prevent launching a project with missing or broken core features. As for quality assurance, Cypress is an amazing tool, ensuring the app is navigable and functional from the browser the same way a user would! It is capable of exporting screenshots and even video of tests and their results, making it great for easy sharing with a team or client. It is a very, very mature library and features an exceptional graphical user interface (GUI) toolset. It's specialties include wholistic integration and full-on end-to-end testing of applications. Because it can load both local files or external web pages/documents via a browser, you can even write tests involving (or exclusively encompassing) external projects of which you have no source-code access.

## Setting up Cypress

Install the package and dependencies:
`npm i cypress@9.7.0 --save-dev`
OR
`npm install -g cypress@9.7.0`

First time set-up:
`./node_modules/.bin/cypress install`

Run cypress in-project via:
`./node_modules/.bin/cypress open`

You can customize your cypress.json file as such:

`
{
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8000",
  "viewportWidth": 1280,
  "viewportHeight": 720
}
`

## Folders/Files and their Purposes!

* `/cypress.json`: Used to override default configuration values.
* `/cypress/fixtures`: Test data; often in JSON.
* `/cypress/integration`: Our test specifications.
* `/cypress/plugins`: Add-ons to expand on Cypress' functionality.
* `/cypress/support`: Scripts; an area where we can add on to Cypress if needed.

## Common Commands

* [describe(), it(), and beforeEach()](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/bundled-tools#Mocha) are afforded to us by Mocha.
    * Describe is used to, well, describe a block of tests!
    * It is used to label a specific test block / unit.
    * BeforeEach allows us an opportunity to add code/setup that will run before each text in the block.
* [cy.visit()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit#Syntax) visits a web page.
* [cy.get()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/get) Retrieves an HTML element based on jQuery/CSS-like selectors.
    * [<entity>.as()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/as) Assign an alias for later use in cy.get() or cy.wait(), use an `@` in a selector to call upon an alias.
* [<element>.find()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/find) Retrieves a child element from inside of a selected element.
* [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) Used for "spying" (checking for use of a particular request) or "stubbing" (replacing the response for a particular request.)
* [cy.wait()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) Waits before proceding with test instructions.
* [<element>.click()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click), [<element>.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type), [<element>.check()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/check) are used to interact with elements and forms in a web page.
